# Create a Chatting DApp using Solidity and ReactJS with the Harmony Blockchain

## Introducation
In this Project, i built a Decentralized chatting application on Harmony test-network from scratch. The DApp will allow users to connect with other people and chat with them. We will develop our smart contract using Solidity which will be deployed on Harmony chain. We will have a basic, easy-to-use UI developed using ReactJS. So, let us begin!

## Prerequisites
* Metamask extension on your browser
You can download it from here  (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)

### Dapp demo link click(https://vimeo.com/682547895)

# Steps:-
## Step-1
Add the custom Harmony test network through the metamask
* Network Name: ```Harmony Testnet```
* New RPC URL:```https://api.s0.b.hmny.io```
* Chain ID:```1666700000```
* Currency Symbol:```ONE```
* Block Explorer URL:```https://explorer.pops.one/```
## Srep-2
### Convert the erc20 address to one token address
* Copy the address from metamask
* Paste it on the search option in the given url (https://explorer.pops.one)
## Step-3
Add some testnet ONE token to use this project
* You can add some ONE token by using this URL (https://faucet.pops.one/)

## Step-3
Now you and your friend login to this project you can chat through the blockchain technology by paying a small amount of one token.
